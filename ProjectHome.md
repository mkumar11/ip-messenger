This is an **IP instant messenger** developed in **java**(version-1.6). This can be used to establish internal communication on LAN. Very good for office use. This is based on broadcasting and TCP/IP. This is a P2P application. The connection for the chat is established between two peers. This application when started identifies all the other peers that are running this application and list's down them with their IP address, host name and the user name(user name used to login to operating system). So you can identify the peers and can establish communication with them. **You also can transfer files**.

Required software to run this project:- jre1.6.0 or higher should be installed in the system. you can download it for free from oracle site (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).

## All The Development For New Version Is Completed. All The Code Has Been Committed. Into Testing Phase. Once The Testing Is Done The New Version will Be Available For Download. ##
